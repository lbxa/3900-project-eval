P1 - ICPC Team Builder
Impact Score: 3
Feasibility Score: 4
Scalability Score: 3

Strengths:
- Addresses a real problem faced by students wishing to participate in the ICPC who might not have readily available teams, thereby lowering barriers to entry.
- Clear and focused requirements, which can help streamline the development process and ensure the project stays on track.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the project is questionable; similar team-building tools already exist in various forms, meaning the academic advancement is minimal.
- Security concerns are not thoroughly addressed in the proposal, particularly regarding the secure storage of students' private data. This is a critical aspect given the involvement of personal information.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Provide a more detailed plan on how to ensure the security and privacy of user data, including encryption methods and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- Investigate existing solutions to better understand the gaps and ensure that the proposed web application offers unique features or improvements, enhancing its impact and academic value.

P2 - Optical Tracking Pipeline
Impact Score: 4
Feasibility Score: 3
Scalability Score: 4

Strengths:
- The project addresses a significant problem in the field of space situational awareness (SSA) with clear implications for satellite tracking and space traffic management.
- The project involves the integration of various advanced software modules such as astrometric positioning and orbit determination, offering potential academic advancements and practical applications.

Weaknesses:
- Integration of existing software modules might not require substantial novel contributions, potentially reducing the academic impact.
- The project scope might be overly ambitious given the limited timeframe of 10 weeks, especially considering the need for rigorous testing and validation with real-world data.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Narrow the scope of the project to focus on a more manageable subset of tasks, such as integrating fewer modules or focusing on optimizing a single module, to ensure completion within the given timeframe.
- Consider involving industry partners or academic researchers in space situational awareness to provide additional guidance and enhance the practical applications and relevance of the project.
